# Project Name

## Description

This project implements a system for generating text using a custom implementation of word embeddings and a bundle-based optimization approach. It includes modules for word embedding generation (`TensorVec.py`), optimization strategies (`Optimizer.py`), and utility functions (`toolfunc.py`). Additionally, it provides a script (`train.py`) for training the system on a corpus and generating text.

## Features

- **Custom Word Embeddings**: The system uses custom word embeddings implemented in `TensorVec.py`, allowing for the representation of words as vectors.
- **Bundle-Based Optimization**: Optimization strategies are implemented in `Optimizer.py`, where words are organized into bundles, and optimization is performed based on the relationships between words within these bundles.
- **Text Generation**: The system can generate text based on a trained corpus using the implemented word embeddings and optimization strategies.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Training

To train the system on a corpus and generate word embeddings:

```bash
python train.py
```

### Text Generation

To generate text using the trained embeddings:

```bash
python generate_text.py
```

## Example

```python
# Example usage code
import torch
from Optimizer import Bundle
from Tensorvec import Vec
from toolfunc import Ut

# Initialize Bundles
model = Bundle(Vec([0, 0, 0]), lr=1)
model1 = Bundle(Vec([1, 1, 1]), lr=1)

# Add associations between Bundles
Bonds = {'a': model, 'b': model1}
model.add(model1, 0)
model1.add(model, 0)

# Forward pass to compute loss
loss = model1.forward(Bonds, optim=False)
print(loss)
```
